# Ex-5d — Simple Cake Order

This is a minimal cake order demo that calculates the total price in Rupees.

How to use

1. Open `Ex-5d/index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Choose a cake, set quantity, and click "Calculate" (or change inputs — it updates automatically).

Notes

- Prices are hard-coded (₹500, ₹450, etc.).
- Images use placeholder URLs; replace with local images if desired.
- The code is intentionally simple and uses plain JavaScript.
