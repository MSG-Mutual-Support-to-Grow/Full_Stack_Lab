# Ex-5c — Currency Converter

A simple client-side currency converter (HTML/CSS/JS) demonstrating the use of <select> elements and onchange events.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page. Open this in a browser.
- `styles.css` — basic styling.
- `script.js` — conversion logic. Uses hard-coded static rates for demo purposes.

Usage:
1. Open `Ex-5c/index.html` in your browser (double-click or use a local server).
2. Choose the "From" and "To" currencies from the drop-down lists.
3. Change the amount — the result updates when you change the selections or the amount (onchange events).

Notes:
- Rates are static and for demonstration only. For real apps, fetch rates from a currency API.
- The UI includes a Swap button to quickly swap the two currencies.
